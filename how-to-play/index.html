  A rectangular board is generated, with mines spread out on it randomly. You know how much mines there are, but don't know <i>where</i> they are.<br>
  Left-click any of the cells - your first click is guarranteed to be safe, on top of that, it will always open a "zero" in this minesweeper clone.<br>
  Opening a cell without a mine will show you a number, denoting the total amount of mines around this cell.<br>
  No number = 0, and it opens all cells around it (often triggering a chain reaction).<br>
  Right click a cell to  "flag" it, to mark it as a mine, that way you won't accidentally open that cell, if you click it. Right-click a flagged cell to unflag it.<br>
  Using logical deduction, open every safe cell without opening a cell with a mine.<br>
  <br>
  e.g., If a cell with a 1 has only one unopen cell near it, that cell has to be a mine - you can flag it.<br>
  If a cell with a 2 already has two (correct!) flags around it, all unflagged cells near it are safe<br>
  - you can l-click or r-click the cell to "chord" it, opening all <i>unflagged</i> cells near it.<br>
  (Watch out, though, as you may open a mine this way.)<br>
  <br>
  You can read about some strategies and patterns on <a href="https://minesweeper.online/help/patterns">minesweeper.online</a>.<br>
  <br>
  Fun fact: on this minesweeper clone, you can chord an overloaded cell (one that has too many flags), opening all <i>unflagged</i> cells near.<br>
  So, albeit forced, it's possible to play it with only RBM.<br>
